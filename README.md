# Naive Bayes classifier for Fake News recognition

The idea of fake news is not a novel concept. Notably, the idea has been in existence even before the emergence of the Internet as publishers used false and misleading information to further their interests. Following the advent of the web, more and more consumers began forsaking the traditional media channels used to disseminate information for online platforms. They are everywhere in our daily life and come especially from social media platforms and applications in the online world. The fake news project aims to help news readers to identify bias and misinformation in news articles quickly and reliably.

In this project, we try to implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier in R and test its performance in the classification of social media posts.

Data is taken from Kaggle and it consists of a training set with 10,240 instances and a test set with 1,267 instances.
